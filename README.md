<h2>Hi there 👋, I am Rahul Chandra</h2>

- 👨🏻‍💻  &nbsp;I’m primarily an <img src="https://github.com/irahulcse/irahulcse/blob/master/assets/flutterio-icon.svg" height=16 /> Mobile App and <img src="https://github.com/irahulcse/irahulcse/blob/master/assets/react.svg" height=16 /> Front End Developer. 
- 👨🏻‍🔬  &nbsp;I like experimenting with tech. This has led me into many interesting domains such as writing Code for co-authoring a paper for creating a software platform for scaling [multidimensional data](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02006) and creating Apps which can help in easing our day to day life.
- 🤗  &nbsp;I love contributing to the open source ecosystem and the community by giving talks, [co-authoring/reviewing papers](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.0200), [building Flutter libraries/mini apps](https://github.com/irahulcse/A-Complete-Guide-To-Flutter), etc. whenever I can.
- 🌱  &nbsp;I’m currently (trying to) learn Python and Rust lang
- 💬  &nbsp;I dabble in Flutter, Java, Python, Rust, UI/UX and spend most of my time automating my life via literally living inside the terminal 🤷🏻‍♂️
- 📝  &nbsp;I often read blogs about random tips/tricks (mostly) related to Flutter [at] [Flutter Geeky Ants](https://blog.geekyants.com/flutter/home?gi=7972c64db096)
- ⚡️  &nbsp;Fun fact about me: I love playing 🕹war games and survive on ☕️ instead of energy drinks 🙇🏻‍♂️ Aparantly this is why I also talk a lot 🤔
