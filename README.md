This has led me into many interesting domains such as writing Code for co-authoring a paper for creating a software platform for scaling multidimensional data[custom wearable hardware](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/352439100/soundbrenner-core-the-4-in-1-smart-music-tool) and building small  app for [flutter ui tool kit](https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/features/silverpushs-technology-lets-advertisers-reach-the-consumer-on-multiple-devices/story/206815.html).

- 📝  &nbsp;I often read blogs about random tips/tricks (mostly) related to Flutter [at] [Flutter Geeky Ants](https://blog.geekyants.com/flutter/home?gi=7972c64db096)
- ⚡️  &nbsp;Fun fact about me: I love playing 🕹war games and survive on ☕️ instead of energy drinks 🙇🏻‍♂️ Aparantly this is why I also talk a lot 🤔
